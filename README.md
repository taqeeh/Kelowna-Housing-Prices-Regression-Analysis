Housing Prices – Predictive Modeling & Regression Analysis

This project explores housing prices in West Kelowna, BC using regression analysis to identify key factors influencing selling price. The analysis focused on ensuring model accuracy, testing assumptions, and extracting actionable insights for pricing strategy.

Key Features:

📂 Data Cleaning & Preparation – Validated dataset, checked for heteroscedasticity, and removed redundant predictors.

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Built scatter plots, correlation matrices, and descriptive statistics to understand relationships.

📈 Regression Modeling – Constructed multiple regression models and refined them by removing insignificant variables.

⚖️ Multicollinearity Handling – Identified high correlations between predictors and reduced redundancy to improve model stability.

📊 Final Model Performance – Adjusted R² of 0.76, explaining 76% of housing price variation.

📐 Forecasting & Confidence Intervals – Predicted prices for new data points with 95% confidence intervals.
